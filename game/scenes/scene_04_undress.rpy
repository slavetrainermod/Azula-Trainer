x "Several weeks have gone by since Azula first started asking personal questions. Her attraction to you became increasingly apparent, and it wasn't long before she demanded that you act as if you were courting her. According to her, she wants to be prepared for when she has to marry, but you can almost believe that she likes you."
x "Almost."
x "Even though she's ordered you to call her 'Azula' instead of 'Fire Lord', you still have to be careful about what you say. There's no question that she still expects to be treated as royalty. You can live with that. In fact, it may be the only way you stay alive."
x "Of course, this new challenge does have its perks…"

War Room:

x "As you approach the door to the War Room, you notice a piece of paper pinned to the door."
x "It's a note that reads, 'Come to my personal quarters at once."
pc "I guess she's skipping the briefing today. This should be interesting."


CG:

x "When you come to Azula's room, you see that the door is ajar."
Option A: Knock
x "Not quite sure what to do, you extend your fist and rap on the door a few times."
a "Do you not understand the meaning of an open door!?"
a "It means 'come in' and don't waste any time!"
x "You immediately walk into the room and find Azula sitting on her bed."
a "Finally!"
Option B: Enter
x "Taking that as a sign to just go in, you walk into the room to find Azula sitting on her bed."
a "It's about time you showed up!"
a "I was becoming extremely bored."
pc "Miss me that much, huh?"
a "That would be a bit generous to say, [pc_name]."

x "With that, Azula hops up from the bed and strides across the room, stopping in front of you."
a "Do you know why I've asked you here?"
pc "I wouldn't hazard a guess."
x "The Fire Lord briefly tilts her head back and laughs."
a "Normally, a guess would indeed be quite hazardous."
a "But I'm not interested in hurting you, so don't worry."
pc "That's very-"
a "For now."
pc "Is that a joke?"
a "Does it sound like I'm joking?"
x "You take a moment to study her face. She's smiling, but you can't tell if that's a good sign or a bad omen. There's a certain sickly aspect to it, at least at first glance."
pc "I would say 'yes'."
a "Nothing to worry about, then."
a "Now, be a good boy and take a guess."
pc "To, ah, do something on the, uh, bed?"
a "Don't stutter, [pc_name]."
a "If you're lucky enough to make it into my bed, I expect you to be fully mature about the prospect."
a "But to answer your question: no."
pc "Then what?"
a "Has anyone ever told you that you're unusually bad at guessing?"
pc "You'd be the first."
a "Is that so?"
x "Azula bites her lip for a second before continuing."
a "I think that, since you've shown me most of your body, it's only fair that I show you most of my body." #emphasis on 'my'
x "Your eyebrows shoot up as far as they can. It's one thing that she wants you to act like you're courting her, but this is downright disturbing. If anyone ever found out…"
a "I can see what you're thinking, and you needn't worry."
a "Nobody is going to know about what happens between you and me, since the only people here are you and I."
a "Unless you're planning on telling someone…"
x "The Fire Princess narrows her brow, suddenly glaring at you mistrustfully. Your only option is to go along with it."
pc "Of course not, Azula. It just seems...rather sudden, that's all."
a "Hmm…"
x "As her face returns to a more hospitable look, you breathe a quiet sigh of relief. From now on, you'll have to be committed."
a "Well, get used to it."

a "I don't have any time to waste, unlike you and the rest of my subjects."
